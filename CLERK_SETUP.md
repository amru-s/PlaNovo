# Clerk Authentication Setup

This project has been successfully integrated with Clerk for authentication using the Next.js App Router approach.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Installation
- Installed `@clerk/nextjs` package
- Added environment variables in `.env.local`

- Located in the `src` directory as required by Clerk

#### `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Wrapped the entire app with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Added authentication header with Sign In/Sign Up buttons and User Button
- Uses Clerk's React components: `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>`, `<UserButton>`

#### `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Added server-side authentication check using `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- Redirects unauthenticated users to home page

#### `src/app/login/[[...rest]]/page.tsx`
- Created dedicated sign-in page using Clerk's `<SignIn>` component
- Customized appearance to match the PlaNovo design system
